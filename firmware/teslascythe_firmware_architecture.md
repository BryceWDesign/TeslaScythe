# TeslaScythe Firmware Architecture

## Overview

The TeslaScythe firmware is designed to run on the onboard MCU (STM32H7 or RP2040) to manage energy harvesting, storage, monitoring, and safety functions in real-time.

## Modules

### 1. Energy Harvesting Control

- Interfaces with RF rectifiers, TEGs, piezo arrays, radiation cells, and quantum capacitors  
- Manages auto-matching impedance tuning and power extraction optimization  

### 2. Power Management

- Regulates power flow through buck/boost converters and MPPT logic  
- Controls charge/discharge cycles of graphene supercapacitors and Li-Si battery pack  

### 3. Sensor Monitoring

- Collects data from temperature, vibration, EM field, charge, and radiation sensors  
- Performs filtering, calibration, and threshold detection  

### 4. Safety & Fault Handling

- Monitors system health and triggers hardware safety disconnects if needed  
- Logs fault events and notifies host system  

### 5. Communication Interface

- Implements telemetry protocols over UART/I2C/SPI for data exchange with spacecraft systems  
- Supports firmware updates and diagnostics
