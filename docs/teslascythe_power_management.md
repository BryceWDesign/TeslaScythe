# TeslaScythe – Power Management System

This document outlines the power management subsystem of TeslaScythe, detailing how energy harvested from various sources is regulated, stored, and distributed to maintain system stability and reliability.

---

## Overview

The power management system coordinates energy flow from the RF Antenna Grid, Thermoelectric Generators (TEG), Vibration MEMS, Radiation Layer, and Casimir Cells into usable power. It balances charging, voltage stabilization, and load distribution while protecting against fault conditions.

## Components

### 1. Power Bus Controller

- Central controller using TI bq40z80 or equivalent.
- Manages buck/boost DC-DC conversion with integrated MPPT for maximum energy extraction.
- Monitors current, voltage, temperature with built-in safety cutoffs.

### 2. Graphene Supercapacitors

- Short-term energy buffer.
- Enables high-rate charge/discharge cycles to smooth transient loads.
- 2.7V to 5.5V range, total capacity 10F to 100F.

### 3. Li-Si Solid-State Battery Bank

- Primary long-term energy storage.
- Provides stable power during low harvesting conditions.
- Radiation-hardened packaging suitable for spaceflight environments.

### 4. Voltage Stabilizer

- Ultra-low dropout regulators or MPPT DC-DC converters stabilize input voltages.
- Ensures consistent supply voltage to onboard MCU and sensors.
