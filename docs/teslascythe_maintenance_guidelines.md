# TeslaScythe Maintenance Guidelines

## Introduction

This document provides the recommended procedures for routine maintenance, troubleshooting, and repairs for the TeslaScythe ambient energy harvester unit.

---

## Routine Inspection

- Monthly visual inspection of enclosure for physical damage or wear  
- Verify mounting integrity and shock absorber condition  
- Check connectors and wiring harnesses for corrosion or loosening  

---

## Electrical System Checks

- Measure output voltages at power bus and storage devices  
- Test functionality of power regulation ICs and safety disconnect switches  
- Inspect polyfuses for signs of degradation or triggering  

---

## Thermal System Maintenance

- Inspect thermal interface materials for degradation or displacement  
- Verify temperature sensors calibration and functionality  
- Clean or replace heat spreaders if dust or contaminants accumulate  

---

## Radiation Components

- Monitor radiation sensor data logs for anomalies  
- Inspect betavoltaic thin film cells visually for damage or delamination  
- Ensure radiation shielding layers remain intact and properly seated  

---

## Vibration Harvester Subsystem

- Confirm proper operation of MEMS piezo arrays via output signal testing  
- Check suspension mounts for compression set or material fatigue  
- Replace foam/silicone standoffs as needed based on vibration performance data  

---

## Firmware and Software

- Update firmware regularly to latest stable release  
- Run diagnostics tools to verify sensor and system health  
- Review error logs and address any recurring faults

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Symptom                 | Possible Cause               | Recommended Action               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| No power output          | Faulty power bus or battery | Check connections; replace faulty components |
| Overheating             | Thermal interface failure    | Replace TIM; verify heat spreader installation |
| Radiation sensor error   | Sensor malfunction           | Calibrate or replace sensor    |
| Vibration harvester no output | Damaged piezo arrays or mounts | Inspect arrays; replace damaged units |
| Firmware crash          | Software bug or corruption  | Reflash firmware; reset system |

## Repair and Replacement

- Use only manufacturer-approved replacement parts  
- Follow anti-static handling procedures for electronic components  
- Document all repairs and component changes in maintenance log  

---

## Safety Precautions

- Always disconnect power before performing maintenance  
- Use appropriate PPE when handling radiation components  
- Follow spacecraft safety protocols during all procedures
