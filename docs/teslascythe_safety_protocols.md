# TeslaScythe Safety Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive safety measures integrated into the TeslaScythe ambient energy harvester to ensure safe operation within spacecraft environments.

---

## Electrical Safety

- Use of polyfuses on all power lines to prevent overcurrent
- Manual hardware disconnect switch accessible for emergency shutdown
- Overvoltage and undervoltage protection circuits on battery and supercapacitor systems
- Use of radiation-hardened ICs to prevent unexpected behavior under cosmic radiation

---

## Thermal Safety

- Thermal interface materials to manage heat dissipation from TEGs and power electronics
- Internal temperature monitoring with automatic shutdown if thresholds exceeded
- Passive heat spreaders integrated into chassis to avoid hotspots

---

## Radiation Safety

- Multi-layered shielding using boron-carbide and lead-alternative nano laminates
- Radiation sensors continuously monitor exposure levels, triggering alerts if dangerous levels are detected
- Beta shielding layers over betavoltaic cells to prevent radiation leakage

---

## Mechanical Safety

- Enclosure designed with aerospace-grade carbon fiber and titanium frame to withstand impact and vibration
- No external moving parts to minimize risk of mechanical failure
- Shock-isolated mounting of vibration harvesters to protect sensitive components

---

## Operational Safety

- Firmware includes watchdog timers and failsafe routines to handle unexpected errors
- Redundant monitoring sensors to cross-verify critical parameters
- Regular self-diagnostics with reporting to spacecraft main control system

---

## Compliance

- Meets SpaceX and NASA safety standards for manned spacecraft equipment
- Tested for electromagnetic compatibility and minimal interference
- Designed with astronaut safety as highest priority

---

## Emergency Procedures

- Manual shutdown procedure via onboard hardware switch
- Safe mode operation limits power output to prevent damage
- Alerts communicated via spacecraft telemetry for immediate action
