# TeslaScythe Safety Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the mandatory safety protocols for installation, operation, and maintenance of the TeslaScythe ambient energy harvester to ensure crew safety and system integrity.

---

## Installation Safety

- Verify spacecraft power is off before installation  
- Use anti-static wrist straps when handling electronic components  
- Ensure all mechanical mounts are secure and free of sharp edges  
- Confirm radiation shielding layers are properly installed and intact  

---

## Operational Safety

- Monitor temperature and radiation levels continuously  
- Avoid exposure to any external mechanical shocks beyond design tolerances  
- Do not open or tamper with internal modules during operation  
- Use onboard emergency disconnect switch in case of anomaly  

---

## Maintenance Safety

- Always power down and isolate TeslaScythe unit before maintenance  
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for radiation components  
- Handle betavoltaic cells with care to avoid damage or contamination  
- Follow spacecraft biohazard and contamination control procedures  

---

## Emergency Procedures

- In case of power surge or failure, immediately activate hardware disconnect  
- Report anomalies to spacecraft control center with detailed logs  
- Isolate the unit physically if radiation leakage or thermal runaway is suspected  
- Do not attempt in-situ repairs without express authorization and training  

---

## Compliance and Training

- All personnel must complete TeslaScythe safety training before handling  
- Follow spacecraft-wide safety standards as primary guidelines  
- Keep this document accessible in operational manuals and onboard databases
