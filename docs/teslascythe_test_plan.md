# TeslaScythe Test Plan

## Purpose

Outline systematic tests to verify performance, reliability, and safety of the TeslaScythe ambient energy harvester.

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Functional Tests

- Verify energy harvesting from each subsystem (EM/RF, thermal, vibration, radiation, quantum) individually  
- Test power regulation and storage under nominal loads  
- Confirm sensor accuracy and onboard MCU responsiveness  

### 2. Environmental Tests

- Thermal cycling between -40°C and +85°C  
- Radiation exposure up to mission specification limits  
- Vibration and shock testing per spacecraft standards  

### 3. Integration Tests

- Verify subsystem interoperability and power bus stability  
- Test failover and emergency disconnect functions  
- Confirm data logging and telemetry communications  

### 4. Safety Tests

- Validate all hardware and software safety interlocks  
- Simulate fault conditions (overvoltage, overheating, radiation spike)  
- Ensure containment of betavoltaic cells and radiation shielding

## Test Procedures

- Use calibrated measurement instruments and certified test chambers  
- Record all results and deviations in test logs  
- Repeat tests for at least three full cycles unless otherwise specified  

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All functional parameters must meet or exceed design specifications  
- No critical safety violations or hardware damage  
- Successful operation through all environmental and integration scenarios  

---

## Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive test reports and certification records  
- Update design documents based on test feedback  
- Train operational staff on test results and implications
