# TeslaScythe: Space-Grade Ambient Energy Harvester

## Mission Profile:
Design a compact, modular, and fully internal ambient energy harvesting unit to operate inside Elon Musk's spacecraft—collecting and storing as much free-floating ambient energy as physically possible within a 3×2×2 ft volume to power astronaut suits or spacecraft backup systems.

## 2. Harvesting Subsystems

### A. EM & RF Energy Collector  
- **Component:** Reconfigurable fractal wideband antenna array (internal)  
- **Target:** Residual EM from comms, electronics, cosmic background  
- **Reverse Engineering:** Based on stealth antenna designs and Tesla’s flat-spiral pancake coil geometry  
- **Tuning:** Auto-matching circuitry handles drift due to temperature  

### B. Thermal Gradient Harvester  
- **Component:** Solid-state ThermoElectric Generators (TEGs)  
- **Placement:** Between inner chassis and spacecraft wall interface  
- **Function:** Harvests waste heat from crew/equipment vs cabin ambient  
- **Optimized for:** Low delta-T gain, long-term operation  
- **Bonus:** Can aid spacecraft heat redistribution  

### C. Radiation/Ion Collector  
- **Component:** Thin-film radiation-to-electric converters (reverse-engineered from betavoltaic cells)  
- **Type:** Polycrystalline layered doped material (safe alpha/beta absorber)  
- **Shielded:** From direct exposure but tuned for penetrating flux  

### D. Vibration Energy Harvester  
- **Component:** MEMS-scale piezo arrays  
- **Sources:** Machinery vibration, human movement inside spacecraft  
- **Mounting:** On shock mount subframe within chassis  
- **Reverse Engineered:** From aerospace fatigue sensors + mechanical wristwatch logic  

### E. Quantum Capacitor Scavenge Assist  
- **Component:** Nano-gap capacitor arrays exploiting near-field vacuum fluctuations (Casimir-like)  
- **Real-World Equivalent:** Based on lab-tested nanocharge gradient effects  
- **Effect:** Slow, ultra-low trickle, but 100% passive

## 3. Storage & Regulation

### A. Main Storage  
- **Tech:** Solid-state Li-Si hybrid batteries  
- **Capacity:** ~300Wh total (~6x iPhone 14 batteries or partial suit operation cycle)  
- **Safety:** Non-volatile, thermal runaway protected  

### B. Buffer Layer  
- **Tech:** Graphene-layer supercapacitors  
- **Function:** Smooth power from spikes; handle fast bursts

## 5. Materials

- Graphene-coated copper mesh (EM/radiation harvesting)  
- Doped silicon-germanium TEG plates  
- Boron-carbide layered radiation absorber  
- Aerospace-grade non-magnetic chassis (titanium frame, carbon fiber shell)  
- Vacuum-stable polymers for insulating and mounting

## 6. Key Engineering Rules

- No protrusions or moving exterior parts  
- All harvesters work in parallel, power routed through a smart regulator  
- Prioritize low-wattage continuous draw over high spikes  
- Overdesign safety systems to Elon-level standards (SpaceX/Starlink tolerances)
