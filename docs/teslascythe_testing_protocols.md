# TeslaScythe â€“ Testing Protocols and Procedures

## 1. Electrical Testing
- Verify voltage and current outputs from each harvesting subsystem
- Test power regulation circuits for efficiency and stability
- Measure battery charging and discharge cycles

## 2. Environmental Testing
- Thermal cycling to simulate spacecraft temperature fluctuations
- Vibration and shock testing simulating launch and operational conditions
- Radiation exposure testing for component resilience

## 3. Functional Testing
- Validate energy harvesting under simulated ambient conditions (RF, thermal gradients, vibration, radiation)
- Confirm system responsiveness to varying input levels
- Test fail-safe and safety disconnect mechanisms

## 4. Safety Testing
- Overcurrent and short-circuit protection verification
- Thermal runaway prevention under fault conditions
- EMC/EMI compliance testing

## 5. Data Collection & Analysis
- Logging performance metrics during all tests
- Analyzing efficiency and identifying losses
- Documenting anomalies and corrective actions
