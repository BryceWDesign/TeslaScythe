# TeslaScythe â€“ Testing and Validation Plan

This document outlines the testing phases and validation criteria for the TeslaScythe energy harvesting system.

---

## 1. Module-Level Testing

- Functional tests for each harvester subsystem (EM/RF, Thermal, Vibration, Radiation, Quantum)
- Electrical characterization of power output under simulated conditions
- Environmental stress tests (thermal cycling, vibration, radiation exposure)

---

## 2. Integration Testing

- Verify proper power combining and regulation across subsystems
- Test safety disconnects and fault isolation mechanisms
- Confirm communication between MCU and sensors

---

## 3. Environmental Testing

- Thermal vacuum chamber tests simulating spacecraft conditions
- Radiation hardness verification with particle accelerators or gamma sources
- Mechanical shock and vibration testing per aerospace standards

---

## 4. Long Duration Testing

- Continuous operation over mission-equivalent timeframes
- Monitoring for degradation of components and efficiency
- Firmware stress and recovery tests

---

## 5. Validation Criteria

- Minimum power output meets or exceeds 90% of design targets
- System passes all safety and reliability standards
- Demonstrated modular repairability and maintainability

---

## Notes

- Testing protocols follow NASA and ESA standards where applicable
- Results to be documented thoroughly for certification and review
