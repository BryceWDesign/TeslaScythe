# TeslaScythe â€“ Monitoring & Safety Systems

This document outlines the monitoring and safety subsystems integrated within TeslaScythe to ensure reliable operation and astronaut safety.

---

## 1. Sensor Suite

- Temperature sensors monitor thermal conditions across all subsystems.
- Vibration sensors detect mechanical stresses and impacts.
- Electromagnetic field (EMF) sensors ensure proper operation of EM harvesters.
- Radiation sensors track cumulative and instantaneous exposure levels.
- Charge monitors measure stored and flowing electrical energy.
