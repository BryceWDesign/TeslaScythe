# TeslaScythe â€“ Testing & Validation Plan (Preliminary)

## Scope
As of this release, the TeslaScythe system is in the concept and documentation phase. Due to funding constraints, no physical hardware tests have been performed. This document outlines the intended validation roadmap and test methodologies.

## Planned Testing Approach

### ðŸ“¦ Subsystem-Level Tests
- RF harvesting module: signal response characterization using VNA and RF sources
- TEG module: heat gradient vs. voltage output curve
- Vibration MEMS: output under sinusoidal table excitation (20â€“200 Hz)

### ðŸ”Œ Integration Testing
- Combined harvester input regulation via power bus simulator
- Overvoltage & thermal fault injection

### ðŸ§ª Environmental Tests (future)
- Vacuum tolerance
- Radiation exposure (ionizing & particle)
- Thermal cycling from -50Â°C to +120Â°C

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¡ Simulations and subsystem models under preparation  
ðŸ”´ No lab testing or prototype assembly has been performed

## Call to Action
If you are a university, lab, or organization interested in helping test the TeslaScythe platform, please reach out or submit a GitHub issue.
