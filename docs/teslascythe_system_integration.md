## 1. Power Flow Architecture

- Energy harvested from multiple sources (EM/RF, thermal, vibration, radiation, quantum) converges at the Power Combiner Bus.
- Smart power regulation circuits prioritize continuous, stable output to downstream loads.
- Buffer storage using graphene supercapacitors smooths transient power fluctuations before feeding the solid-state battery pack.

## 2. Subsystem Interfacing

- All harvesting modules interface via standardized connectors and signal protocols.
- Impedance matching and tuning circuits dynamically optimize antenna and harvesting element efficiency.
- Thermal harvesters and vibration sensors include isolation mounts to prevent mechanical interference.

---

## 3. Control and Monitoring

- Central MCU orchestrates subsystem operation, monitors health, and manages safety protocols.
- Adaptive algorithms balance power distribution based on current demand and harvesting conditions.
- Real-time telemetry enables remote diagnostics and firmware updates.

---

## 4. Safety and Redundancy

- Redundant communication paths and power buses ensure reliability.
- Automatic fault isolation disables malfunctioning modules without affecting overall system operation.
- Compliance with spacecraft safety standards including EMI/EMC and radiation tolerance.
