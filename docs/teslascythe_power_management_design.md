## 1. Power Input Handling

- Inputs: Multiple energy harvesting sources (RF antenna array, TEGs, vibration MEMS, radiation converters, quantum capacitors)
- Each input feeds into dedicated rectification and impedance matching circuits to maximize energy extraction efficiency.
- Smart adaptive matching ICs continuously tune circuits based on source conditions and load.

---

## 2. Power Combining Bus

- Outputs from all harvesters converge on a power combiner bus.
- Power signals are combined using low-loss, high-efficiency DC-DC converters.
- Circuit topology prioritizes continuous trickle inputs over sporadic spikes.

## 3. Voltage Regulation & Buffering

- Voltage Stabilizer:
  - Regulates combined input voltage to a steady level compatible with storage and output systems.
  - Uses low-dropout (LDO) regulators and buck-boost converters for high efficiency.

- Buffer Layer:
  - Graphene-layer supercapacitors act as short-term energy reservoirs.
  - Smooth transient spikes and provide burst power when needed.
  - Charge cycles exceed one million with negligible degradation.

## 4. Primary Storage

- Solid-state Li-Si hybrid battery bank:
  - Stores up to ~300Wh.
  - Designed for safety with thermal runaway protection and non-volatile chemistry.
  - Supports deep cycling aligned with astronaut suit power demands.

---

## 5. Output Power Delivery

- Regulated output feeds directly into astronaut suit power rails or spacecraft backup systems.
- Includes overcurrent, overvoltage, and short circuit protection.
- Intelligent load shedding to prioritize critical systems under low charge scenarios.

---

## 6. Monitoring & Telemetry

- Integrated sensor suite monitors:
  - Voltage, current, temperature, radiation exposure, vibration levels.
- MCU logs data and provides system status to spacecraft telemetry bus.
- Fault detection routines trigger safety disconnect if anomalies arise.

---

## 7. Safety Considerations

- Multiple redundant fail-safes for overvoltage, thermal runaway, and mechanical shock.
- All components rated for spacecraft environmental tolerances.
- Enclosures designed for EMI shielding and physical impact resistance.

---

## Notes

- Emphasis on modular, scalable design.
- Designed to be integrated into TeslaScythe chassis seamlessly.
- Prioritize continuous, low-wattage power delivery for astronaut safety and system reliability.
