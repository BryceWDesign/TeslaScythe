# TeslaScythe â€“ Grounding and Shielding Guidelines

This document outlines the grounding and shielding practices implemented in the TeslaScythe project to ensure signal integrity, minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), and enhance system reliability, particularly in aerospace environments.

## Grounding Strategy

### Star Ground Topology

- The TeslaScythe system employs a star grounding scheme where all ground connections converge at a single, low-impedance point.
- This topology reduces ground loops and minimizes voltage differentials between subsystems.
- The star ground point is located near the main power distribution board.

### Ground Planes

- Multilayer PCBs use dedicated ground planes to provide low impedance paths and reduce noise coupling.
- Ground planes also serve as heat spreaders for thermal management.

### Chassis Ground

- The system chassis is connected to earth/reference ground through a controlled low impedance path.
- All connectors have shield pins tied to chassis ground to ensure shielding continuity.

## Shielding Practices

### Cable Shielding

- External cables, especially telemetry and power lines, use braided or foil shields grounded at the chassis end.
- Shielded cables reduce susceptibility to external EMI and prevent emissions.

### Enclosure Shielding

- The electronics enclosure is made from conductive materials, typically aluminum, providing a Faraday cage effect.
- Gasket seals maintain shielding integrity at seams and access points.

### Component Shielding

- Sensitive analog and RF modules include metal shielding cans or EMI gaskets to isolate from noisy digital circuits.
- Critical components are physically separated on the PCB layout to minimize coupling.

## EMI Mitigation

- Use of ferrite beads and common-mode chokes on power and signal lines.
- Filtering capacitors at power inputs to suppress high-frequency noise.
- Careful routing of high-speed signals to avoid crosstalk.

---

## Testing and Verification

- Ground resistance measurements ensure compliance with design specifications.
- EMI/EMC testing conducted per aerospace standards (e.g., MIL-STD-461).
- Shield continuity verified with continuity testers and network analyzers.

## Notes

- Proper grounding and shielding are critical for spaceflight hardware to withstand harsh electromagnetic environments.
- Changes to grounding or shielding designs must be reviewed for potential impact on system performance.
