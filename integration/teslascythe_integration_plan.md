# TeslaScythe Integration Plan

## Objective

Outline the step-by-step approach for integrating all hardware and firmware components into the complete TeslaScythe system.

## Integration Steps

1. **Mechanical Assembly**  
   - Assemble internal skeleton frame with outer carbon fiber shell  
   - Install mounts and insulators for subsystem components  

2. **Subsystem Installation**  
   - Mount and wire EM/RF harvesting antenna arrays and Tesla spiral coils  
   - Attach thermal differential TEG plates and interface pads  
   - Install vibration MEMS arrays on shock mounts  
   - Integrate radiation conversion layers and quantum capacitor arrays  

3. **Power System Setup**  
   - Connect graphene supercapacitors and solid-state battery pack  
   - Wire power bus controller and power regulation modules  

4. **Sensor & MCU Installation**  
   - Mount sensor suite and connect to MCU  
   - Install safety disconnect hardware  

5. **Firmware Deployment**  
   - Flash initial firmware build on MCU  
   - Run diagnostic checks and calibrate sensors  

6. **System Testing**  
   - Perform subsystem functional tests  
   - Conduct full system power harvesting and regulation tests  
   - Validate safety and fault handling protocols  

7. **Final Calibration & Optimization**  
   - Fine-tune impedance matching and power routing  
   - Optimize firmware parameters based on test data
